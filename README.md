# PhySMC.jl - Physical simulation safe of Probabalistic programming

> NOTE!: this is a work in progress and the API is NOT stable

Defines an interface that supports arbitrary order of execution often found in probabilistic programming scenarious (such as Gen.jl). 

Documentation is a work in progress, please refer to docstrings in `src/PhySMC.jl` in the meantime.
